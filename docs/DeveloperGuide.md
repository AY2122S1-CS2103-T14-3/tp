### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/ui/Ui.java)

[![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t14-3.github.io/tp/images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MainDisplay`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that 
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mycrm/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Job`, `Contact`, `Product`, `Template`, `History` 
  objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

* [Adding a contact](#adding-a-contact)
* [Hiding a contact](#hiding-a-contact)
* [Listing contacts](#listing-contacts)
* [Adding a template](#adding-a-template)
* [Deleting a template](#deleting-a-template)
* [Constructing an email](#constructing-an-email)

### Adding a Contact

#### Implementation

The adding a contact mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This Contact created is stored internally using 
`UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCrm` object.  
Additionally, `addContact` allows to have only partially info of a client with consideration of privacy. Commands
such as `AddContact n/xxx e/xxx` `addContact n/xxx c/xxx` are all acceptable.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addContact` command behave when executed by a user: 

![](images/contact/AddContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the adding a contact mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/contact/AddContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `AddContactCommandParser#parse`, `ParserUtil#parseName` will be called to create a name using 
"Sans", `ParserUtil#parsePhone` to create a phone using "83921823", `ParserUtil#parseEmail` to 
create an email using "Sans@gmail.com", `ParserUtil#parseAddress` to create an address using "Maxwell...".  
Then create a contact using the new name, phone, email and address.

Note that `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, are optional, but at least one of these 3 fields
must exist.

![](images/contact/AddContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Editing a Contact

#### Implementation

The Editing a Contact mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism reads and modifies a target contact
object from `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `editContact` command behave when executed by a user:

![](images/contact/EditContactActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the adding a contact mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/contact/EditContactParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `EditContactCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of contactList).
- `EditContactDescriptor` will only get the values of `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, and `Tags` 
if their respective prefixes are present.
- `isHidden` is will not be handled by `EditContactDescrptior`, it will be updated in `createEditedContact`.

`EditContactCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the target contact's index and
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`: "Frisks", "88888888", "Frisks@gmail.com"
and "Jurong West" from the command string respectively.

![](images/contact/EditContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Contact

#### Implementation

### Finding a Contact

#### Implementation

### Hiding a Contact

#### Implementation

The Hiding a Contact mechanism follows the `EditCommand` mechanism in `AddressBook`. It hides a specific contact
which is visible only when user types the command `listContact -a`. Hidden contact will be tagged as `Hidden`. The
Edited contact created is stored internally using `UniqueContactList` inside the `MyCrm` object

### Undoing Hiding a Contact

Implementation and usage details are similar to [Hiding a Contact](#hiding-a-contact) design
pattern. Please refer to `hideContact` command implementation details.

### Listing Contacts

#### Implementation

### Adding a Template

#### Implementation

The Adding a Template mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This template created is stored internally using
`UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object. 

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `addTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/AddTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Adding a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/AddTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for 
`AddTemplateCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline 
reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Within `AddTemplateCommandParser#parse`, `ParserUtil#parseSubject` will be called to create a subject using 
"Completed", `ParserUtil#parseBody` to create a body using "Dear customer..." and create a template using the new
subject and body.

![](images/mail/AddTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

Additionally, before adding the new template into `Model`, `Template t` will be checked if a similar copy exist
within `Model`. The conditions required is:

* If both templates have the DO NOT same `Subject` content i.e. there is an existing template with subject "Completed".

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Unique Template**

* Current choice: Unique by Subject
  * Pros: Easy to understand and differentiate templates
  * Cons: Does not allow for different variations of general / common email headers i.e. "Completed" subject header 
    cannot be reused with different body content based on scenario
* Alternative: Unique by Subject and Body
  * Pros: Enables different variations of general / common email headers
  * Cons: May not be user-friendly as it may be hard to differentiate templates as some may be too similar at first 
    glance. Such as, minor typos, copy and paste with a couple of different words. Higher risk of confusion.    

### Editing a Template

#### Implementation

The Editing a Template mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This mechanism reads and modifies a target template 
object from `UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `editTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/EditTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Editing a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/EditTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `EditTemplateCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of templates).
- `EditTemplateDescriptor` will only get the values of `Subject` and `Body` if their respective prefixes are present. 

`EditTemplateCommandParser#parse` will call `ArgumentMultimap#getPreamble` to get the specified template index and 
`ArgumentMultimap#getValue` to extract both `Subject` and `Body`: "Completed" and "Order Completed!" from the 
command string respectively.

![](images/mail/EditTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Template

#### Implementation

The Deleting a Template mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This template removes a target template object from
`UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object.

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `deleteTemplate` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/DeleteTemplateActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Deleting a Template mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/DeleteTemplateParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `DeleteTemplateCommandParser#parse`,
- `Index` must be is valid (within the range of templates) and at least one field to be edited, for the mechanism to
  execute successfully.
- `ParserUtil#parseIndex` will be called to extract the index of the specified template to delete.

![](images/mail/DeleteTemplateSequenceDiagram.png)

### Constructing an Email

#### Implementation

The Constructing an Email mechanism is facilitated by `MyCRM`. This email is constructed based of the information 
from a specified job and template from `UniqueJobList` and `UniqueTemplateList` inside the `MyCRM` object. A mailto URL 
will be generated, sending users to their default mailing application with details of the job and template. 

#### Usage

The activity diagram below illustrates how the events of `mail` command behave when executed by user:

![](images/mail/MailActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Constructing an Email mechanism behaves at each step.

![](images/mail/MailParseSequenceDiagram.png)

Within `MailCommandParser#parse`,
- `JobIndex` must be is valid (within the range of job).
- `TemplateIndex` must be is valid (within the range of templates).
- `ParserUtil#parseIndex` will be called to extract both the index of the specified job and template to mail.

![](images/mail/MailSequenceDiagram.png)

An additional feature of constructing an email is the generation of a mailto URL, allowing for users to transfer 
their job and template details to the user's default mailing application.

Given below is an example of the generation of a mailto URL:

![](images/mail/MailUrlSequenceDiagram.png)

After the URL is generated, the URL string is passed to a JavaFX `Hyperlink` object that when clicked, will execute 
the URL path.
