### Project: MyCRM

MyCRM is a desktop application for managing client contacts, repair job statuses, and product information that has been optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you type quickly, MyCRM can complete customer relationship management tasks faster than traditional GUI applications.
